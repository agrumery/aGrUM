  """
  The Bayesian network gives us the probability of the target knowing the values of the other variables.
  The value above which the probability needs to be for the input to be classified as that class is called the threshold.
  This method calculates the optimal threshold using the roc or precision-recall curve.

  Parameters
  ----------

          Bayesian network to work on
      targetName: str
          Name of the target
      csvfilename: str

      usePR: bool
          indicates if the threshold to choose is Prevision-Recall curve's threhsold or ROC's threshold by default.
          ROC curves should be used when there are roughly equal numbers of observations for each class.
          Precision-Recall curves should be used when there is a moderate to large class imbalance especially for the target's class.
      beta: float
          the beta value to use when computing the F score. Only used when usePR is True.
      significant_digits: int
          number of significant digits when computing probabilities

          the scoring will be ignored if using a learning algorithm

          AIC means Akaike information criterion

  """
  Tells the Bayesian network which constraints should be put on the structure of the network.
  More details on the nature of these constraints can be found in the documentation for the constructor of this class

  Parameters
  ----------
      constraints: dict()
          A dictionary designating the constraints that we want to put on the structure of the Bayesian network.
          Ignored if using a learning algorithm where the structure is fixed, such as TAN or NaiveBayes.
          The keys of the dictionary should be the strings "PossibleEdges", "MandatoryArcs" and "ForbiddenArcs".
          The format of the values should be a tuple of strings (tail,head) which designates the string arc from tail to
          head. For example, if we put the value ("x0"."y") in MandatoryArcs, the network will surely have an arc
          going from x0 to y.
          Note: PossibleEdge between nodes x and y allows for either (x,y) or (y,x) (or none of them) to be added to
          the Bayesian network, while the others are not symmetric.
