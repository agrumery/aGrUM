`pyAgrum <http://agrum.org>`_ is a scientific C++ and Python library dedicated to
Bayesian networks (BN) and other Probabilistic Graphical Models. Based on the C++
`aGrUM <https://agrum.lip6.fr>`_ library, it provides a high-level interface to
the C++ part of aGrUM allowing to create, manage and perform efficient computations
with Bayesian networks  and others probabilistic graphical models : Markov random fields (MRF),
influence diagrams (ID) and LIMIDs, credal networks (CN), dynamic BN (dBN), probabilistic relational models (PRM).

.. important::
  Since pyAgrum 2.0.0, the package name follows PEP8 rules and is now `pyagrum` (lowercase). 
  Please use ``import pyagrum`` instead of ``import pyAgrum`` in your code.

  See the `CHANGELOG <https://gitlab.com/agrumery/aGrUM/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md?ref_type=heads#changelog-for-200>`_  for more details.

The module is generated using the `SWIG <http://www.swig.org>`_ interface
generator. Custom-written code was added to make the interface more
user friendly.

pyAgrum aims to allow to easily use (as well as to prototype new algorithms on)
Bayesian network and other graphical models.

pyAgrum contains :
  * :ref:`tutorials as jupyter notebooks <Notebooks>`.
  * a :ref:`comprehensive API documentation <Reference manual>`.
  * a `gitlab repository <https://gitlab.com/agrumery/aGrUM>`_.
  * and a `website <http://agrum.org>`_.
