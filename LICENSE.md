The aGrUM/pyAgrum library and all its derivatives are distributed under the dual LGPLv3+MIT license, see LICENSES.

`SPDX-License-Identifier: LGPL-3.0-or-later OR MIT`

You can therefore integrate this library into your software solution but it will remain covered by either the LGPL v.3 license or the MIT license or, as aGrUM itself, by the dual LGPLv3+MIT license at your convenience.
If you wish to integrate the aGrUM library into your product without being affected by this license, please contact us (info@agrum.org).

This library depends on different third-party codes. See src/aGrUM/tools/externals for specific COPYING and explicit permission of
the authors, if needed.

If you use aGrUM/pyAgrum as a dependency of your own project, you are not contaminated by the GPL license of some of these third-party
codes as long as you use only their aGrUM/pyAgrum interfaces and not their native interfaces.
