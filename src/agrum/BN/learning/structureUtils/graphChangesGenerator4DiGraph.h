/** @file
 * @brief The basic class for computing the set of digraph changes allowed by
 * the user to be executed by the learning algorithms
 *
 * Structure learning algorithm try different modifications of the graph. Class
 * GraphChangesGenerator4DiGraph provides a simple way to compute those that we
 * wish to perform. For instance, in the basic LocalSearch algorithm for
 *learning
 * directed graphs, one may expect that all possible arc additions, deletions
 *and
 * reversals can be applied and GraphChangesGenerator4DiGraph provides exactly
 * this set of operations. However, there may be cases where we would like to
 * apply these operators, say, only on a subgraph. In this case, we should use
 * the derived class of GraphChangesGenerator4DiGraph named
 * GraphChangesGeneratorOnSubDiGraph. Anyway, all the search generators should
 * have the following minimal methods:
 *   - void setGraph ( const DiGraph& ) : assigns a new graph as a starting
 *     point to the generator of graph change operators
 *   - void modifyGraph ( const GraphChange& ) : indicate to the generator
 *     that the graph has been changed and that we need to compute the new
 *     operators that result from this change
 *   - void clearChanges () : empty the set of possible changes
 *   - methods begin () and end () that return iterators allowing to parse the
 *     available set of changes.
 *
 * Basically, the idea is to use method setGraph at the beginning of the
 * structure learning in order to initialize the possible set of changes.
 * Then, parse this set using a for ( auto iter = generator.begin ();
 * iter != generator.end (); ++iter ) loop and compute the scores
 * induced by these changes. When this is done, flush the generator by
 * calling method clearChanges. Then iterate changes and after each new change
 * applied, used again the iterator for loop, and so on. Note that, whenever
 * you execute method modifyGraph, this will automatically flush the current
 * list of changes and put into the list only the changes that are affected
 * by the graph modification.
