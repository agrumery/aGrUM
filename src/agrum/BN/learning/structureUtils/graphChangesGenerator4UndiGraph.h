/** @file
 * @brief The basic class for computing the set of undigraph changes allowed by
 * the user to be executed by the learning algorithms
 *
 * Structure learning algorithm try different modifications of the graph. Class
 * GraphChangesGenerator4UndiGraph provides a simple way to compute those that
 *we
 * wish to perform. For instance, in the basic PC algorithm for learning
 * undirected graphs, one may expect that all possible edge additions and
 * deletions can be applied and GraphChangesGenerator4UndiGraph provides exactly
 * this set of operations. This class provides the following minimal methods:
 *   - void setGraph ( const UndiGraph& ) : assigns a new graph as a starting
 *     point to the generator of graph change operators
 *   - void modifyGraph ( const GraphChange& ) : indicate to the operator set
 *     that the graph has been changed and that we need to compute the new
 *     operators that result from this change
 *   - void clearChanges () : empty the set of possible operators
 *   - methods begin () and end () that return iterators allowing to parse the
 *     available set of operators.
 *
 * Basically, the idea is to use method setGraph at the beginning of the
 * structure learning in order to initialize the possible set of operators.
 * Then, parse this set using a for ( auto iter = operator_set.begin ();
 * iter != operator_set.end (); ++iter ) loop and compute the scores
 * induced by these changes. When this is done, flush the operator set by
 * calling method clearChanges. Then iterate changes and after each new change
 * applied, used again the iterator for loop, and so on. Note that, whenever
 * you execute method modifyGraph, this will automatically flush the current
 * list of changes and put into the list only the changes that are affected
 * by the graph modification.
