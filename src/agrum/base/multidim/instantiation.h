   * @class Instantiation
   * @headerfile instantiation.h <agrum/base/multidim/instantiation.h>
   * @brief Class for assigning/browsing values to tuples of discrete
   * variables.
   * @ingroup multidim_group
   *
   * Instantiation is designed to assign values to tuples of variables and to
   * efficiently loop over values of subsets of variables. This class can be
   * used in two different flavors:
   * - the tuple of variables in the Instantiation is related to a
   * multidimensional array and, when we loop over the possible values of the
   * tuple, we also loop at the same time over the corresponding values in the
   * array.
   * - the tuple of variables in the Instantiation is not related to a
   * multidimensional array and we can loop over the possible values of the
   * tuple without looping over values fo any array.
   *
   * An Instantiation can be associated/deassociated to a given
   * multidimensional array using the
   * MultiDimAdressable::registerSlave(Instantiation& i) and
   * MultiDimAdressable::unregisterSlave functions. Note that, to be
   * registrable, the Instantiation must have precisely the same variables as
   * the array. As a consequence, adding or removing a variable from a
   * Instantiation associated to an array will unregister it. This behavior is
   * compulsory as, if it were still associated, it would not be possible to
   * retrieve a correct value of the array given a value of the Instantiation.
   * For instance, if M[A,B,C] is an array indexed by Boolean variables A,B,C,
   * Which value of M should be returned if B=0 and C=0? We do not know for
   * sure as we do not know the value of A. Note also that, at any time, you
   * can unregister a Instantiation from its master multidimensional array and
   * you can ask to associate it (provided the tuple of variable match).
   *
   * To print information about a Instantiation use the following function:
   * @see operator<<(std::ostream&, const Instantiation&).
