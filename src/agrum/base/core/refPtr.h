   * @brief Smart pointers
   * @ingroup basicstruct_group
   * @ingroup refptr_group
   *
   * aGrUM's smart pointers keep track of the number of times the value they
   * point to is referenced. When all smart pointers on a given value have been
   * deleted, the value itself is also deleted. Thus, using RefPtr, you do not
   * have to worry anymore about memory leaks. Note however that smart pointers
   * impose some constraints on the way you program. Here are some rules of
   * thumb: when several smart pointers must point to the same value, use only
   * once the constructor taking in argument *val, and use the copy constructor
   * or the assignment operator for the other smart pointers, else all the
   * smart pointers will think they point to different values and thus they
   * will all try to deallocate the dumb pointer they encapsulate, hence
   * resulting in segmentation faults. In fact, the correct way to use the *val
   * constructor is writing things like @code RefPtr ( new myObject ) @endcode
   * In particular, never deallocate yourself a dumb pointer you have
   * encapsulated into a smart pointer.
   *
   * @par Usage example:
   * @code
   * // creation of smart pointer
   * RefPtr<int> ptr1 (new int (4));
   *
   * // copying (and sharing) this pointer into new smart pointers
   * RefPtr<int> ptr2 = ptr1, ptr3;
   * ptr3 = ptr1;
   *
   * // make ptr2 point toward nothing (this does not deallocate int (4) as it
   * // is pointed to by ptr1 and ptr3)
   * ptr2.clear ();
   *
   * // modifying the value pointed to by the dumb pointer contained in ptr1
   * *ptr1 = 5;
   *
   * // print the content of ptr3
   * cerr << *ptr3 << " = 5" << endl;
   *
   * // check whether ptr1 and ptr3 reference the same dumb pointer
   * if (ptr1 == ptr2) cerr << "reference the same dumb pointer" << endl;
   *
   * // check whether ptr1 and ptr2 contain a dumb pointer
   * if (ptr1 && !ptr2) cerr << "check containers" << endl;
   * @endcode
   *
   * @tparam Val The type referenced by the gum::RefPtr.

     * This constructor creates an object encapsulating the pointer passed in

     * The RefPtr assumes that the value pointed to has been allocated on the
     * heap using the new operator. If this is not the case, then using RefPtr
     * will result in an undefined behavior when the RefPtr is destroyed (ok,
     * we all know what it means: a segmentation fault). To avoid deleting
     * several times the pointer encapsulated, the safe way to use the RefPtr
     * is certainly through calls like: @code RefPtr( new myObject ) @endcode
     * Passing an already allocated pointer to the constructor is not
     * forbidden.  However, in this case, care should be taken not to allow
     * external functions to delete the value pointed to by val. Moreover, care
