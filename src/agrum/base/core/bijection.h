   *
   * This class is designed for modeling a gum::Bijection between two sets, the
   * idea is following :
   *  - We want to create a gum::Bjection relation between type T1 and type T2,
   *  - For x in T1, there exists only one y in T2 associated to x,
   *  - For y in T2, there exists only one x in T1 associated to y,
   *  - The user inserts all the (x, y) associations and can search efficiently
   *  the values thus associated.
   *
   * @tparam T1 The first type of elements in the gum::Bjection.
   * @tparam T2 The second type of elements in the gum::Bjection.
   * @tparam Gen If true, this will be replaced by a implementation omptimized
   * for non-scalar types.
