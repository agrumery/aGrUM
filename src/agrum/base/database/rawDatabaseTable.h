 * Class RawDatabaseTable is intended to store in RAM the raw/original data
 * of a database. Such raw data are not well suited for learning tasks
 * because they need to be interpreted by the learning algorithm, which would
 * incur a strong overhead. However, reading a CSV file and interpreting its
 * data in order to reshape them in a way that will allow fast parsing by
 * learning algorithms is also very time consuming. So, if you are unsure
 * about the correct interpretation and need to change it several times either
 * before processing the learning or during several learning phases, it is
 * efficient to first read the CSV file and store its useful data (removing
 * comments, for instance) into a first database table and, then, use this
 * preprocessed table to produce quickly the interpreted database table that
 * will subsequently be used by the learning. The purpose of the
 * RawDatabaseTable class is precisely to implement this preprocessed table.
