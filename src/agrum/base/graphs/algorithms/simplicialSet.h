     * graph. When we add or remove nodes or edges within this undirected graph,
     * the simplicial set updates its list of simplicial, almost simplicial
     * and quasi simplicial sets. Recall that a node is simplicial if, along
     * with
     * its neighbors, it forms a clique. A node X is almost simplicial if it
     * has a neighbor, say Y, such that, after removing Y, X and its neighbors
     * form a clique.
     *
     * @param graph The undirected graph the simplicial sets of which we are
     * interested in.
     * @param log_domain_sizes The logarithm of the domain sizes of the
     * nodes/variables. This is used for two different reasons: i) it enables
     * to retrieve the simplicial nodes that have the smallest domain size
     * (useful for triangulations); and ii) it enables to compute and update
     * the log-weight of the cliques containing the nodes (the log-weight of a
     * clique is the sum of the log_domain_sizes of its nodes).
     * @param log_weights The logarithm of the weights of cliques.
     * @param theRatio Let L be the number of edges between neighbors of a
     * given node and let L' be the number of all the possible edges between
     * these neighbors (n * (n+1) / 2). If L/L' >= theRatio, then we consider
     * that the node and its neighbors quasi form a clique and, hence is a
     * quasi-simplicial node.
     * @param theThreshold for a safe triangulation (see Bodlaender), almost and
     * quasi-simplicial nodes should not be eliminated, unless their weight is
     * lower than the highest weight of the cliques created so far. Here, we
     * consider it safe if the weight of a new clique is lower than
     * (1+theThreshold) * this highest weight. This enables flexibility.

     * fact that an argument is passed as a pointer means that it is not copied
     * within the SimplicialSet, but rather it is only referenced within it.
     * @throws OperationNotAllowed exception is thrown if the graph, the
     * log_modalities or the log_weights are null pointers.
     * @warning Note that we allow log_domain_sizes to be defined over
