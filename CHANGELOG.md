## Changelog for 2.0.1

## Changelog for 2.0.0

This major update brings several important changes that align with our goals of improving usability, compliance, and
consistency. Below are the three main motivations behind this significant upgrade:

#### 1. License Change : MIT+LGPLV3

The first major change in version 2.0.0 is the update to our software license. This change ensures better alignment with
modern open-source standards and provides clearer guidelines for usage, distribution, and
modification ([see here for details](https://agrum.gitlab.io/articles/dual-licenses-lgplv3mit.html)).

#### 2. Package Name Update to Follow PEP8

To adhere to Python's PEP8 naming conventions, we have renamed the package from `pyAgrum` to `pyagrum`. We are aware
that this change may cause some inconvenience, but it is necessary to ensure consistency with Python's style guidelines
and improve the overall user experience. The transition to version 2.0.0 is the right time to implement this change, as
it allows us to make a clean break and set a solid foundation for future development.

#### 3. Class Renaming: Potential to Tensor

In an effort to make the library more intuitive and reflective of its functionality, we have renamed the `Potential`
class to `Tensor`. This change better represents the mathematical nature of the class and aligns with common terminology
in the field ([see here for details](https://agrum.gitlab.io/articles/tensors-in-pyagrum.html)).

#### 4. Modular Code Structure

We have reworked the internal structure of the code to make it more modular. This redesign allows for easier
extensibility and maintenance in the long term. By breaking down the code into more independent and reusable components,
we aim to facilitate future enhancements and possible contributions from the community.

## Changelog for 1.0.0

The aGrUM's team is very proud to announce the release of aGrUM/pyAgrum 1.0.0!

This long journey sometimes strewn with pitfalls, but which often brought great satisfactions, began with this first
commit (subversion):

> add8dbff5 | 13 years ago | phw | test?

aGrUM/pyAgrum is now definitely no longer a test :-) Parallelization of inference in Bayesian networks is the important
feature that allows us to symbolically assert a level of quality of aGrUM. The 1.0.0 release shows that we also believe
the API will remain stable in a medium term.

pyAgrum continues its path as a wrapper of aGrUM but with more and more specific features. Some of them are intended to
be implemented in C++ and eventually integrated in aGrUM (causality, etc.), others will certainly remain specificities
of pyAgrum.

In the near future, for aGrUM and pyAgrum, we expect many more new features and releases ! Stay tuned!

- aGrUM

    - VariableElimination, ShaferShenoy and LazyPropagation are now parallelized.
    - Better use of d-separation in ShaferShenoy and LazyPropagation.
    - Better initialization/registrations used Meyers singleton.
    - Better 0-dimensional Potential.
    - new `gum::IBayesNet::check()` to test if the BN is completely and well-defined.

- pyAgrum

    - Better documentation and argument order for `gum.BNLearner.__init__`.
    - Better numpystyle for docstrings.
    - Better tests and notebooks.
    - Better signature for `gum.Potential.arg{max|min}`.
    - New `gum.IBayesNet.check()` to test if the BN is completely and well-defined.
    - More consistent API : `with_labels` default is True everywhere.

## Changelog for 0.22.9

This tag is a pre-relase for 1.0.0 (!).

- aGrUM

    - Added a new Multithreaded facility which supports easily both `openMP` and `STL`.

This tag (0.21.0) is the last version that supports python 2.7. We are already worked and will deliver a 0.22.0 tag as
soon as possible, which will be dedicated to this move and will then be the first tag without python 2.7 support.

The next tag (0.22.0) will be the (new) last minor version before the release of agrum/pyAgrum 1.0.0 (:fist: :smirk: ).

      algorithms, constraints, etc.).

    - Add a new CI for last gcc (g++11 for now).
